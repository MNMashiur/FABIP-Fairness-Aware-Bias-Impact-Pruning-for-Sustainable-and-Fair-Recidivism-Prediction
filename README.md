## Overview

**FABIP (Fairness-Aware Bias Impact Pruning)** is a structured neural network pruning framework that simultaneously reduces demographic bias and computational cost in classification models.

Unlike traditional pruning methods, FABIP:
- Identifies **bias-inducing neurons** using a **Bias Impact Score (BIS)**
- Applies **structured pruning** (removes neurons, not just weights)
- Maintains model accuracy while improving fairness and efficiency

The framework is evaluated across:
- COMPAS (criminal justice)
- Adult Income (finance/hiring)
- German Credit (finance)

---

## Motivation

Machine learning systems often produce biased outcomes due to historical and societal inequalities embedded in data.

Existing approaches:
- Fairness constraints → reduce accuracy
- Standard pruning → ignores bias

**FABIP solves this by:**
- Detecting bias at neuron level
- Removing bias-causing neurons
- Preserving performance

## Mathematical Framework

### Bias Impact Score (BIS)

BIS is computed using **masking (ablation)**:

A neuron is temporarily removed (masked), and the change in prediction disparity across sensitive groups is measured. This captures the **causal contribution of that neuron to bias**.

### Importance

Measured using gradient magnitude:

I(j) = || ∂L / ∂h_j ||

### Fairness Pruning Score (FPS)

FPS(j) = λ1 * BIS(j) − λ2 * Importance(j)

High FPS → prune first

### Structured Pruning

Entire neurons are removed, reducing:
- Parameters
- FLOPs
- Latency

---

## Architecture

The baseline model is a 3-hidden-layer **MLP with BatchNorm and Dropout**:

```
Input (7 features)
    ↓
Linear(7 → 128) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Linear(128 → 64) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Linear(64 → 32)  + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Linear(32 → 1)   [Binary output via BCEWithLogitsLoss]
```

After FABIP structured pruning at ratio 0.30, the architecture becomes physically smaller (exact dimensions depend on which neurons are identified as bias carriers — typically around `128 → 64 → 32` shrinks to `~90 → ~44 → ~22`).

**Training configuration:**
| Hyperparameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Optimiser | Adam |
| Learning rate | 1e-3 (baseline), 5e-4 (fine-tune) |
| Weight decay | 1e-4 |
| LR scheduler | ReduceLROnPlateau (patience=4, factor=0.5) |
| Early stopping patience | 10 epochs |
| Batch size | 256 |
| Random seed | 42 |

## Baselines

Three baselines are implemented and compared against FABIP:

### 1. Vanilla (Unpruned)
A standard neural network trained with cross-entropy loss and no fairness intervention. Establishes the accuracy ceiling and the bias floor — the worst-case fairness and best-case efficiency.

### 2. Magnitude Pruning (Standard Unstructured)
The lowest-magnitude weights globally are zeroed using L1-based unstructured pruning (40% of weights). Fine-tuned afterward.

**Key limitation (why it appears in this study):** Zeroed weights are still stored in memory and still participate in matrix multiplication. The network dimensions are unchanged. **FLOPs do not decrease.** This is the most common mistake in the pruning-fairness literature and is explicitly demonstrated in this work.

### 3. FairPrune (Wu et al., 2022)
Neurons whose activations are most correlated with the sensitive attribute $A$ are zeroed out. This is the closest prior work to FABIP, applied originally to dermatological disease diagnosis.

**Key limitation:** Also unstructured — correlation-based zeroing does not change matrix dimensions, so FLOPs remain unchanged. Furthermore, it uses a single signal (correlation) rather than FABIP's dual-verification BIS.

### FABIP (Ours)
Structured pruning guided by the ensemble BIS + FPS. Physically removes neurons and rebuilds the network smaller. The only method in this comparison that achieves genuine reductions in FLOPs, parameters, and inference latency.

## Results

All results are on the **COMPAS test set** (926 samples), reported after fine-tuning.

### Main Results Table

| Model | Accuracy | F1 | AUC | DP ↓ | EO ↓ | DI → 1.0 | #Params | FLOPs | Latency (μs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vanilla | 0.6771 | 0.6071 | 0.7176 | 0.2718 | 0.4598 | 2.1964 | 11,841 | 22,336 | 23.604 |
| Magnitude Pruning | — | — | — | — | — | — | 11,841 | 22,336 | — |
| FairPrune | — | — | — | — | — | — | 11,841 | 22,336 | — |
| **FABIP (Ours)** | **0.6782** | **0.6140** | **0.7209** | **0.2603** | **0.4340** | **2.0623** | **6,213** | **11,476** | **18.842** |

> Magnitude Pruning and FairPrune are included in the notebook with full metrics. Their FLOPs and #Params columns match Vanilla because both are **unstructured** — this is an intentional design point of the study.

### FABIP vs Vanilla — Summary of Improvements

| Metric | Vanilla | FABIP | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Demographic Parity ↓ | 0.2718 | 0.2603 | **−4.2% (fairer)** |
| Equalized Odds ↓ | 0.4598 | 0.4340 | **−5.6% (fairer)** |
| Disparate Impact → 1.0 | 2.1964 | 2.0623 | **Closer to 1.0** |
| Accuracy | 0.6771 | 0.6782 | **+0.1% (unchanged)** |
| F1-Score | 0.6071 | 0.6140 | **+0.7%** |
| AUC | 0.7176 | 0.7209 | **+0.5%** |
| FLOPs | 22,336 | 11,476 | **−48.6%** |
| Parameters | 11,841 | 6,213 | **−47.5%** |
| Inference latency | 23.604 μs | 18.842 μs | **−20.2%** |

The key finding: FABIP improves all three fairness metrics, maintains (and slightly improves) accuracy, and cuts computational cost nearly in half — none of which is achievable with unstructured pruning methods.

### Fairness Metric Definitions

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Demographic Parity (DP)** | `|P(ŷ=1|A=0) − P(ŷ=1|A=1)|` | Difference in positive prediction rates between groups. Lower = fairer. |
| **Equalized Odds (EO)** | `|TPR_priv − TPR_unpriv| + |FPR_priv − FPR_unpriv|` | Combined difference in error rates between groups. Lower = fairer. |
| **Disparate Impact (DI)** | `P(ŷ=1|A=1) / P(ŷ=1|A=0)` | Ratio of positive prediction rates. Values close to 1.0 = fairer. |

## Ablation Study

To rigorously justify each component of FABIP, three degraded variants are evaluated:

| Variant | BIS Used | Importance Used | Pruning Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| No-BIS | ✗ | ✓ | Structured | Proves BIS is necessary — removing unimportant neurons alone does not improve fairness |
| No-Importance | ✓ | ✗ | Structured | Proves importance weighting is necessary — BIS-only pruning can hurt accuracy |
| No-Ablation | Gradient only | ✓ | Structured | Proves ablation verification adds value over gradient BIS alone |
| **FABIP (Full)** | Gradient + Ablation | ✓ | Structured | Best fairness with minimal accuracy cost |

All four variants use the same pruning ratio (0.30) for a fair comparison. Results confirm that every component contributes — removing any single element degrades either fairness or accuracy.

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

FABIP is evaluated across five pruning ratios to characterise the fairness–efficiency–accuracy trade-off:

| Pruning Ratio | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| 0.10 | Minimal fairness improvement; FLOPs barely change |
| 0.20 | Moderate fairness gains; small FLOPs reduction |
| **0.30** | **Best balance — chosen as the default** |
| 0.40 | Further FLOPs reduction; minor additional accuracy cost |
| 0.50 | Aggressive pruning; accuracy begins to degrade noticeably |

The chosen default of **30% pruning** achieves the best balance between fairness improvement, accuracy preservation, and computational reduction across all three datasets.

---


## Multi-Dataset Generalisation

A full pipeline (vanilla training → FABIP) is run on all three datasets independently. This confirms that FABIP is not overfit to the COMPAS dataset or recidivism prediction specifically, but is a general fairness-aware pruning framework.

**Summary of FABIP improvements over Vanilla across datasets:**

| Dataset | Sensitive Attr. | DP Improvement | EO Improvement | FLOPs Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMPAS | Race | −4.2% | −5.6% | ~48% |
| Adult Income | Sex | Consistent reduction | Consistent reduction | ~45–50% |
| German Credit | Age | Consistent reduction | Consistent reduction | ~45–50% |

Exact numbers for Adult and German Credit are printed in **Section 13** of the notebook.

## What "Sustainable" Means

The term **"sustainable"** in the project title is defined operationally and precisely throughout the code and this README. It is not used loosely.

A model is sustainable if it satisfies all three of the following:

1. **Fair** — demonstrates reduced demographic disparity (lower DP and EO) compared to an unpruned baseline
2. **Accurate** — maintains predictive performance within an acceptable threshold (< 2% accuracy loss in our experiments)
3. **Computationally efficient** — achieves genuine reductions in FLOPs, parameter count, and inference latency through structured (not unstructured) pruning

Standard unstructured pruning methods (including FairPrune) fail condition 3 because zeroing weights does not change the physical dimensions of weight matrices. Only FABIP's structured approach satisfies all three conditions simultaneously.
